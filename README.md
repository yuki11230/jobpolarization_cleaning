occ_00.py and 0cc_00_2003.py create a consistent panel of the employment share data for more than 300 occupations from CPS survey.\
occ_01_task.py/occ_01_wg.py rank the previous data by either task components (routiness of the job)/ or the mean hourly wage of the occupations.\
occ_02.py compares the employment share I computed with the employment share in Autor and Dorn (2013).
